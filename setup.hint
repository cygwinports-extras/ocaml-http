sdesc: "OCaml HTTP daemon and client library"
ldesc: "OCaml HTTP is an OCaml library freely inspired from Perl's 
HTTP::Daemon module that permits you to write simple HTTP daemons in 
OCaml.

OCaml HTTP contains also a tiny implementation of a HTTP client which
can be used to retrieve resources via GET HTTP method and to iter on
them (useful for huge resources which can't be kept in memory)."
