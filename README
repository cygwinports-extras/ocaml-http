ocaml-http
------------------------------------------
OCaml HTTP is an OCaml library freely inspired from Perl's HTTP::Daemon 
module that permits you to write simple HTTP daemons in OCaml.

The main API let you define a HTTP daemon specification, which contains, 
among other parameters, a callback function that is invoked each time a 
request is received. The callback function will be invoked with an 
instance of an object representing the received HTTP request and an 
out_channel connected to the remote HTTP client socket.

OCaml HTTP contains also a tiny implementation of a HTTP client which 
can be used to retrieve resources via GET HTTP method and to iter on 
them (useful for huge resources which can't be kept in memory).

Build instructions:
  unpack ocaml-http-0.1.3-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
	 unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./ocaml-http-0.1.3-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/ocaml-http-0.1.3-X-src.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/ocaml-http-0.1.3-X.tar.bz2
